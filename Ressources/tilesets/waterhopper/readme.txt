This file includes frames for a simple pixelated tadpole animation. The creature image is 32 per 32 bits.

Tadpoles are toad/frog larvae, resembling fish offspring but rounder and cuter.

Tip: For better animation, instead of going from frame 6 back to frame 1, return to frame 5, then 4 etc. The animation would follow these frames: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and repeat.

I created this originally for a CS2D mod, and adapted it with transparency and additional frames to release it here.
